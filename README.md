# Performance Dashboard

### We are developing an interactive dashboard to analyze and visualize the sales performance of a company, comparing actual results against set targets. This tool aims to provide insightful metrics and trends to help drive strategic decision-making

## Problem Statement

Our company is focused on selling products and aims to understand whether we are meeting our sales targets. To achieve this, we need a comprehensive analysis across various dimensions:

- Monthly Performance: Identify which months we are meeting or exceeding our sales targets and which months we are falling short.
- Sales Personnel Analysis: Determine which salespersons are meeting their individual targets and which are not, allowing us to recognize top performers and provide support where needed.
- Variance Analysis: Calculate the variance between actual sales and targets to understand the extent of overperformance or underperformance.
To facilitate this analysis, we propose the development of a dynamic and interactive dashboard. This tool will consolidate all relevant data in one place, providing a clear and intuitive interface for tracking sales performance. The dashboard will offer:

- Real-time Data Visualization: Interactive charts and graphs to visualize sales trends and performance metrics.
- Customizable Views: Filters and options to drill down into specific time periods, regions, or sales teams.
- Automated Reporting: Generate reports that highlight key insights and actionable recommendations.
By leveraging this dashboard, our stakeholders will be empowered to make informed strategic decisions, ensuring that we stay on track to meet our sales objectives and drive business growth
